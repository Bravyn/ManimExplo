# Manim Exploration

This repository contains examples and explorations using Manim, a mathematical animation library. The animations created here demonstrate various concepts and techniques using Manim Community Edition (or Manim GL).

## Installation

Before running the examples, make sure you have Manim installed. You can install it by following the installation instructions for the specific version you choose to use:

- [Manim Community Edition Installation Guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)
- [Manim GL Installation Guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/latest/installation.html)

## Examples

### Hello, World!

The `scene.py` script showcases a simple "Hello, World!" animation using Manim. It displays the text "Hello, World!" on the screen and performs a fade-out animation.

To run the example, execute the following command:

```bash
manim hello_world.py HelloWorld -p
